# Resize 1280

This is a python3 script which resizes images to 1280x960.

It solves a specific problem I have where I often want smaller images 
to send via email and files that are 4032x3024 are just too large for 
my needs. (I like to preserve disk space & bandwidth.)

Note: The script will overwrite the original image after scaling it down.

I've included a Mac OS application created using DropScript, which 
will only be useful for people with Python3 and the Pillow library 
installed, who are also running Mac OS X. You are both welcome.

I've read about py2exe and py2app but haven't used them yet...
I'll dig into them when I have time.
